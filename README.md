Telecom Churn Analysis – Data Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using SQL Server for data processing and Power BI for visualization.
The goal is to clean, explore, and prepare reliable data and present key churn insights through an interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
SQL Server – Data loading, cleaning, and transformation
Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard creation

📂 Data Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading
Imported raw telecom customer data into SQL Server.
Created staging tables for initial data inspection.

2️⃣ Data Exploration (SQL Server)
Performed exploratory data analysis using SQL queries:
Checked distinct values for categorical columns
Identified NULL and missing values
Validated data consistency and basic distributions

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Removed or handled NULL values based on business logic
Inserted cleaned and validated data into a Production (Prod) table
Ensured the Prod table contains analytics-ready data

4️⃣ Data Modeling & Visualization (Power BI)

Connected Power BI directly to SQL Server Prod table
Created calculated columns and measures using DAX
Built an interactive dashboard to analyze:
Churn vs Non-Churn customers
Total churn by churn category
Churn by contract type
Churn by tenure
Churn by state
Churn by payment method and services

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Overall churn rate
Customer segmentation insights
Key factors influencing churn
Dynamic filters for deeper analysis

🎯 Key Outcomes

Clean, production-ready telecom customer dataset
Improved understanding of churn patterns
Interactive Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders
End-to-end analytics workflow using SQL Server + Power BI
